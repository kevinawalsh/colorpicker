# Credits and History

This color picker forked from code by Jeremy Wood that was part of the
now-retiring (JavaGraphics Project)[http://javagraphics.blogspot.com].

A newer and more modern fork of the same code is maintained by Daniel Heid at
(dheid/colorpicker)[https://github.com/dheid/colorpicker].  That project uses
maven and has a dependency on SLF4J.
